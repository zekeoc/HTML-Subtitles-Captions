            <h2>Captions</h2>
            <p>Captions are generally given in the same language as the original content. It includes relevant sound effects or background noises because the intended audience is those who cannot hear the audio for some reasons.</p>

            <h2>Subtitles</h2>
            <p>Subtitles are typically provided in a language other than the original content and are intended for people who are not speakers of the language that the original content is being served in.</p>
            <h3>Translations for pigeons</h3>
            <p>
                Obviously, none of us can understand what pigeons are saying, so we'll just make up some subtitles! Create your own time stamps and invent your own dialog!
